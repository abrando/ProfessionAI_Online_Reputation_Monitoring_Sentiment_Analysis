# ProfessionAI_Online_Reputation_Monitoring_Sentiment_Analysis
ProfessionAI Master AI Engineering. Progetto per il corso "MLOps e Machine Learning in Produzione"


# MachineInnovators – Online Reputation Monitoring  
### Sentiment Analysis • FastAPI • Docker • Grafana (Infinity Plugin) • MLOps Pipeline

This project implements a complete system for **online reputation monitoring** through automated **sentiment analysis** of social media text.  
It uses **RoBERTa**, **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **Grafana Infinity datasource** for lightweight monitoring—no Prometheus or databases required.

The system is designed as an **MLOps-ready pipeline**, supporting:
- Sentiment model inference via API  
- Containerized deployment  
- Real-time monitoring dashboards  
- Simple retraining workflow  
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions  
- Google Colab notebook for final submission

# Project Objective

Companies must track social media sentiment to maintain a positive online reputation.  
Manual monitoring is slow, expensive, and unreliable.

This project enables:

- Automated classification of user sentiment  
- Continuous monitoring via Grafana dashboards  
- FastAPI-based inference API for easy integration  
- A retraining-ready architecture  
- Containerized deployment for scalability  
- Lightweight monitoring (no Prometheus, no DB)
